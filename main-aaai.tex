\begin{abstract}
Backbone is widely used in random SAT solving, ALL-SAT computing and planning.
In this paper, we propose a greedy-whitening based approach for computing backbones of propositional Boolean formulae.
We present a greedy-based algorithm with four heuristic searching strategies to compute an under-approximation of non-backbone and
a whitening-based algorithm to compute an approximation of backbone.
The exact backbone is computed by applying iterative test backbone on the approximations.
We implemented our approach in a tool \tool and conducted experiments on instances from Industrial and Random tracks of SAT Competitions
between 2002 and 2015. Experimental results demonstrate that \tool is comparable
to the state-of-the-art tool cb100. Moreover, \tool needs less SAT solver calls and outperforms cb100 on most of hard instances.

%For the formulae that with disperse backbones, our approach is able to compute an estimation of literals that are highly likely to be %backbones and applied backbones extraction algorithms in the following steps.
%Experiments show the efficiency of the approach using satisfiable instances from SAT Competition, including both SAT track and Maximal %Satisfiability Sub-formulae(MSS) extracted from UNSAT track. Moreover, compared with state-of-the-art approach proposed in 2015, our %approaches has advantages in hard formulae and MSS formulae.
