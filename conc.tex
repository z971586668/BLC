\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conc}
This paper propose a novel greedy-whitening based approach \tool to compute backbone of a propositional formulae. 
\tool comprise with two parts, a greedy based part to compute the under-approximation of backbone of a formula, and an whitening-based part to compute the approximation of backbone. The exact backbone is computed by applying iteratively checking on the approximations. We implements \tool and evaluate it on both industrial formulae with a number of 138 and random formulae with a number of 6606 compared to state of art cb100. Experiment results demonstrate that \tool is able to reduce 11\% running time comparing to cb100. Moreover, for hard random formulae, \tool is able to cut off 40\% running time.
