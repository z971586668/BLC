\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conc}
In this paper, we proposed a novel greedy-whitening based approach \tool to compute backbone of propositional formulae.
We implemented our approach in a tool \tool. Experimental results demonstrated that
\tool performs better than the state of the art tool cb100 on industrial formulae and hard random formulae.
